# LeagueScoresWebsite
The current aim of the project is to make a bowling league tracking website where you can see what your scores are and where you played. 
In the future I hope to be able to expand different game rules like Nine Tap and other versions of bowling.
### The site will include:
* login system
* roles
* leader boards for past tournments
* and more
